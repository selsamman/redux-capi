# redux-capi

Redux-capi is alternative to react-redux.  It allows you to packages up actions, selectors and thunks as an API to be consumed by React components.  It uses a declarative specification for the API that eliminates the need to write reducers reducers for state mutations and provides for independent testing of the API and components that consume them.
